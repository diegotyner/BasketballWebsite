Lincoln went 3-0 and beat #1 team twice.  They have 3 upcoming games the week of Feb. 7, and win the league if the go 3-0.  Two of those games are easy wins, the other is to avenge a loss.",,

Danielle is shown scoring 14 pts and we win 42-23.  Ref's don't seem to call fouls committed against us anymore.  This game we got called for 17 fouls, the other team only 3.  It's very hard to get called for a slapping or grabbing foul inside against us.",,

Lincoln has 3 guards out with sprained ankles and are very weak passing the ball in this game.  I included more game footage to show that Danielle is more mobile this year and kind of a terror on defense.  Her shooting was off a bit, but I included her 2 made shots and the three misses she probably should have made.",,

One starter was out sick, our 2nd post player, and it totally changed the complexion of our game.  We couldn't run our offense effectively or post up on smaller players, and our interior defense and rebounding suffered.  Danielle got held to 8 points by a combination of good Harker defense, our inability to pass the ball effectively and several non-calls by the referee's.",,

Two quick turnovers ended any hope. Danielle did manage 10 points, but was no-call hacked on 3 misses...AND she missed her 3 freethrows.",,

On the plus side, Lincoln shot 70% from the field and were not ""blown out"" by a veteran ""A"" team.   Strong defense and good offense (when we didn't turn the ball over), are things we can build on.  Danielle had 20 points on 10 out of 12 shooting.",,

The teams were pretty evenly matched last year when they split 2 games....totally different story this year.  We even won handily without one of our starters...a big improvement by us.  Lincoln needed a confidence builder heading into league action next week.  Danielle scored 16 points on 8-10 shooting, had 6 steals and 3 assists.  (We won the league last year by beating Overfelt...that's what 2022 indicates...so I guess that's why they took out the banner.  It'll get raised to the rafters soon.)",,

WG scores 5 points in last 15 seconds, including desperation bank shot with .2 on clock to force OT.  Danielle scores 14.  Lincoln played ""good enough to win"", but needed to be better to overcome the ref's.  Lots of WG fouls did not get called all game, but specifically on two short shots by Danielle near the end of the game where the ""big"" #45 hammers her.  Any of the four free throws would have been enough for Lincoln to secure the win.  #45 didn't get called for a foul all game, yet in these highlights can be seen committing 6 or 7 fouls, depending how ""tight"" you want to call the game...the ref's decided NOT to call the game.",,

Thank you Leigh #34.   The ref call Danielle for traveling, which as it turns out, was about as accurate as most of the calls/non-calls for the night.

Elyssa typically absorbs a lot of foul non-calls on her shots and rebounds. At the end of the clip is a ""not too unfamiliar"" site of a player ripping Elyssa's arms trying to get at the ball...this sort of thing was a season-long frustration as it occurred very regularly and was almost never called out by the refs.",,

- 1st call is a clean block, where #2 gets bailed out with foul call…#2 gets to convert 2 free throws.
- 2nd is incidental contact where #2 flops to the group with barely any contact…ball bounces off Saratoga out of bounds, but fake foul call gives possession to Saratoga
- 3rd isn’t even close to a foul, yet #2 flopper sells it again and gets two more points of free throws",,

Maybe 1 call was legit...the 2nd foul.  She rarely benefits from this sort of ""soft' foul call but occasionally one does crop up.  4th foul was all ball and the 5th foul was bailing out a dribbler that created a turnover.
