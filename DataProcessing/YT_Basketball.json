She was 10-12 from the field, with 3-4 free throws."

    "Description": "The season ended with a 60-47 playoff loss to Leland.  Danielle scored 24 points (and had 2 taken away by a ref)...also had 4 assists in her final game with Lincoln.  She was 12-17 from the field.  She was fouled numerous times, but somehow only got a single free throw.  Same old story of High School basketball...if you are bigger and stronger, opposing players have a right to foul you and ref's let it go.  (But it doesn't work the other way around.)"
